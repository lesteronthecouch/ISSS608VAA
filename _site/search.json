If you have less than 5 groups, dealing with other distribution plots is probably better.\nIt works well when there is a clear pattern in the result, like if there is an obvious ranking in groups. Otherwise group will tend to overlap each other, leading to a messy plot not providing any insight."

    "text": "3.1 Learning Outcome\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to create interactive data visualisation by using functions provided by ggiraph and plotlyr packages.\n\n\n3.2 Getting Started\nFirst, write a code chunk to check, install and launch the following R packages:\nggiraph for making ‘ggplot’ graphics interactive. plotly, R library for plotting interactive statistical graphs.\nDT provides an R interface to the JavaScript library DataTables that create interactive table on html page.\ntidyverse, a family of modern R packages specially designed to support data science, analysis and communication task including creating static statistical graphs.\npatchwork for combining multiple ggplot2 graphs into one figure. The code chunk below will be used to accomplish the task.\n\npacman::p_load(ggiraph, plotly, \n               patchwork, DT, tidyverse) \n\n\n\n3.3 Importing Data\n\nexam_data &lt;- read.csv(\"data/Exam_data.csv\")\n\n\n\n3.4 Interactive Data Visualisation - ggiraph methods\nggiraph is an htmlwidget and a ggplot2 extension. It allows ggplot graphics to be interactive.\nInteractive is made with ggplot geometries that can understand three arguments:\nTooltip: a column of data-sets that contain tooltips to be displayed when the mouse is over elements.\nOnclick: a column of data-sets that contain a JavaScript function to be executed when elements are clicked.\nData_id: a column of data-sets that contain an id to be associated with elements.\nIf it used within a shiny application, elements associated with an id (data_id) can be selected and manipulated on client and server sides. Refer to this article for more detail explanation.\n\n\n3.4.1 Tooltip effect with tooltip aesthetic\nBelow shows a typical code chunk to plot an interactive statistical graph by using ggiraph package. Notice that the code chunk consists of two parts. First, an ggplot object will be created. Next, girafe() of ggiraph will be used to create an interactive svg object.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = ID),\n    stackgroups = TRUE, \n    binwidth = 1, \n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL, \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 6,\n  height_svg = 6*0.618\n)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.5 Interactivity\nBy hovering the mouse pointer on an data point of interest, the student’s ID will be displayed.\n\n\n3.5.1 Displaying multiple information on tooltip\nThe content of the tooltip can be customised by including a list object as shown in the code chunk below.\n\n\n3.6 Interactivity\n\nexam_data$tooltip &lt;- c(paste0(     \n  \"Name = \", exam_data$ID,         \n  \"\\n Class = \", exam_data$CLASS)) \n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(\n    aes(tooltip = exam_data$tooltip), \n    stackgroups = TRUE,\n    binwidth = 1,\n    method = \"histodot\") +\n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(\n  ggobj = p,\n  width_svg = 8,\n  height_svg = 8*0.618\n)\n\nWarning: Use of `exam_data$tooltip` is discouraged.\nℹ Use `tooltip` instead.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.1 Customising Tooltip style\nCode chunk below uses opts_tooltip() of ggiraph to customize tooltip rendering by add css declarations.\n\ntooltip_css &lt;- \"background-color:white; #&lt;&lt;\nfont-style:bold; color:black;\" #&lt;&lt;\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = ID),                   \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(    #&lt;&lt;\n    opts_tooltip(    #&lt;&lt;\n      css = tooltip_css)) #&lt;&lt;\n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the background colour of the tooltip is black and the font colour is white and bold.\n\n\n3.6.2 Displaying statistics on tooltip\nCode chunk below shows an advanced way to customise tooltip. In this example, a function is used to compute 90% confident interval of the mean. The derived statistics are then displayed in the tooltip.\n\ntooltip &lt;- function(y, ymax, accuracy = .01) {\n  mean &lt;- scales::number(y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  sem &lt;- scales::number(ymax - y, accuracy = accuracy)\n  paste(\"Mean maths scores:\", mean, \"+/-\", sem)\n}\n\ngg_point &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n                   aes(x = RACE),\n) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS, \n                   tooltip = after_stat(  \n                     tooltip(y, ymax))),  \n    fun.data = \"mean_se\", \n    geom = GeomInteractiveCol,  \n    fill = \"light blue\"\n  ) +\n  stat_summary(aes(y = MATHS),\n    fun.data = mean_se,\n    geom = \"errorbar\", width = 0.2, size = 0.2\n  )\n\nWarning: Using `size` aesthetic for lines was deprecated in ggplot2 3.4.0.\nℹ Please use `linewidth` instead.\n\ngirafe(ggobj = gg_point,\n       width_svg = 8,\n       height_svg = 8*0.618)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.3 Hover effect with data_id aesthetic\nCode chunk below shows the second interactive feature of ggiraph, namely data_id.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(           \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),             \n    stackgroups = TRUE,               \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618                      \n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\nInteractivity: Elements associated with a data_id (i.e CLASS) will be highlighted upon mouse over.\n\n\n3.6.4 Styling hover effect\nIn the code chunk below, css codes are used to change the highlighting effect.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(data_id = CLASS),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(                        \n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),  \n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\") \n  )                                        \n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\nNote: Different from previous example, in this example the ccs customisation request are encoded directly.\n\n\n3.6.5 Combining tooltip and hover effect\nThere are time that we want to combine tooltip and hover effect on the interactive statistical graph as shown in the code chunk below.\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(tooltip = CLASS, \n        data_id = CLASS),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj = p,                             \n  width_svg = 6,                         \n  height_svg = 6*0.618,\n  options = list(                        \n    opts_hover(css = \"fill: #202020;\"),  \n    opts_hover_inv(css = \"opacity:0.2;\") \n  )                                        \n)                                        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.6 Click effect with onclick\nonclick argument of ggiraph provides hotlink interactivity on the web.\nThe code chunk below shown an example of onclick.\n\nexam_data$onclick &lt;- sprintf(\"window.open(\\\"%s%s\\\")\",\n\"https://www.moe.gov.sg/schoolfinder?journey=Primary%20school\",\nas.character(exam_data$ID))\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(onclick = onclick),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +               \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\ngirafe(                                  \n  ggobj =

object will be displayed on the web browser upon mouse click.\n\n\n3.6.7 Coordinated Multiple Views with ggiraph\nCoordinated multiple views methods has been implemented in the data visualisation below.\nNotice that when a data point of one of the dotplot is selected, the corresponding data point ID on the second data visualisation will be highlighted too.\nIn order to build a coordinated multiple views as shown in the example above, the following programming strategy will be used:\nAppropriate interactive functions of ggiraph will be used to create the multiple views. patchwork function of patchwork package will be used inside girafe function to create the interactive coordinated multiple views.\n\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = MATHS)) +\n  geom_dotplot_interactive(              \n    aes(data_id = ID),              \n    stackgroups = TRUE,                  \n    binwidth = 1,                        \n    method = \"histodot\") +  \n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100)) + \n  scale_y_continuous(NULL,               \n                     breaks = NULL)\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n       aes(x = ENGLISH)) +\n

observations between plots and the tooltip aesthetic is optional but nice to have when mouse over a point.\n\n\n3.7 Interactive Data Visualisation - plotly methods!\nPlotly’s R graphing library create

Different from other plotly platform, plot.R is free and open source.\nThere are two ways to create interactive graph by using plotly, they are:\nby using plot_ly(), and by using ggplotly()\n\n\n3.7.1 Creating an interactive scatter plot: plot_ly() method\nThe tabset below shows an example a basic interactive plot created by using plot_ly().\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n             x = ~MATHS, \n             y = ~ENGLISH)\n\nNo trace type specified:\n  Based on info supplied, a 'scatter' trace seems appropriate.\n  Read more about this trace type -&gt; https://plotly.com/r/reference/#scatter\n\n\nNo scatter mode specifed:\n  Setting the mode to markers\n  Read more about this attribute -&gt; https://plotly.com/r/reference/#scatter-mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.2 Working with visual variable: plot_ly() method\n\nplot_ly(data = exam_data, \n        x = ~ENGLISH, \n        y = ~MATHS, \n        color = ~RACE)\n\nNo trace type specified:\n  Based on info supplied, a 'scatter' trace seems appropriate.\n  Read more about this trace type -&gt; https://plotly.com/r/reference/#scatter\n\n\nNo scatter mode specifed:\n  Setting the mode to markers\n  Read more about this attribute -&gt; https://plotly.com/r/reference/#scatter-mode\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.7.3 Creating an interactive scatter plot: ggplotly() method\n\np &lt;- ggplot(data=exam_data, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nggplotly(p)\n\n\n\n\n\nNotice that the only extra line you need to include in the code chunk is ggplotly().\n\n\n3.7.4 Coordinated Multiple Views with plotly\nThe creation of a coordinated linked plot by using plotly involves three steps:\nhighlight_key() of plotly package is used as shared data. two scatterplots will be created by using ggplot2 functions. lastly, subplot() of plotly package is used to place them next to each other side-by-side.\n\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data)\np1 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = ENGLISH)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\np2 &lt;- ggplot(data=d, \n            aes(x = MATHS,\n                y = SCIENCE)) +\n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\nsubplot(ggplotly(p1),\n        ggplotly(p2))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8 Interactive Data Visualisation - crosstalk methods!\nCrosstalk is an add-on to the htmlwidgets package. It extends htmlwidgets with a set of classes, functions, and conventions for implementing cross-widget interactions (currently, linked brushing and filtering).\n\n\n3.8.1 Interactive Data Table: DT package\nA wrapper of the JavaScript Library DataTables\nData objects in R can be rendered as HTML tables using the JavaScript library ‘DataTables’ (typically via R Markdown or Shiny).\n\nDT::datatable(exam_data, class= \"compact\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.8.2 Linked brushing: crosstalk method\n\nd &lt;- highlight_key(exam_data) \np &lt;- ggplot(d, \n            aes(ENGLISH, \n                MATHS)) + \n  geom_point(size=1) +\n  coord_cartesian(xlim=c(0,100),\n                  ylim=c(0,100))\n\ngg &lt;- highlight(ggplotly(p),        \n                \"plotly_selected\")  \n\ncrosstalk::bscols(gg,               \n                  DT::datatable(d), \n                  widths = 5)        \n\nSetting the `off` event (i.e., 'plotly_deselect') to match the `on` event (i.e., 'plotly_selected'). You can change this default via the `highlight()` function.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk:\nhighlight() is a function of plotly package. It sets a variety of options for brushing (i.e., highlighting) multiple plots. These options are primarily designed for linking multiple plotly graphs, and may not behave as expected when linking plotly to another htmlwidget package via crosstalk. In some cases, other htmlwidgets will respect these options, such as persistent selection in leaflet.\nbscols() is a helper function of crosstalk package. It makes it easy to put HTML elements side by side. It can be called directly from the console but is especially designed to work in an R Markdown document. Warning: This will bring in all of Bootstrap!.\n\n\n3.9 Reference\n\n\n3.9.1 ggiraph\nThis link provides online version of the reference guide and several useful articles.

    "text": "In this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to model, analyse and visualise network data using R.\nBy the end of this hands-on exercise, you will be able to:\n\ncreate graph object data frames, manipulate them using appropriate functions of dplyr, lubridate, and tidygraph,\nbuild network graph visualization using appropriate functions of ggraph,\ncompute network geometrics using tidygraph,\nbuild advanced graph visualisation by incorporating the network geometrics, and build interactive network visualisation using visNetwork package.\n\n\n\nIn this hands-on exercise, four network data modelling and visualisation packages will be installed and launched. They are igraph, tidygraph, ggraph and visNetwork. Beside these four packages, tidyverse and lubridate, an R package specially designed to handle and wrangling time data will be installed and launched too.\n\npacman::p_load(igraph, tidygraph, ggraph, \n               visNetwork, lubridate, clock,\n               tidyverse, graphlayouts, \n               concaveman, ggforce)\n\n\n\n\n\nThe data sets used in this hands-on exercise is from an oil exploration and extraction company. There are two data sets. One contains the nodes data and the other contains the edges (also know as link) data.\n\n\nNote: GAStech-email_edges.csv which consists of two weeks of 9063 emails correspondances between 55 employees.\n\n\n\nNote: GAStech_email_nodes.csv which consist of the names, department and title of the 55 employees.\n\n\n\nIn this step, you will import GAStech_email_node.csv and GAStech_email_edges-v2.csv into RStudio environment by using read_csv() of readr package.\n\nGAStech_nodes &lt;- read_csv(\"data/GAStech_email_node.csv\")\n\nRows: 54 Columns: 4\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): label, Department, Title\ndbl (1): id\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nGAStech_edges &lt;- read_csv(\"data/GAStech_email_edge-v2.csv\")\n\nRows: 9063 Columns: 8\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (5): SentDate, Subject, MainSubject, sourceLabel, targetLabel\ndbl  (2): source, target\ntime (1): SentTime\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will examine the structure of the data frame using glimpse() of dplyr.\n\nglimpse(GAStech_edges)\n\nRows: 9,063\nColumns: 8\n$ source      &lt;dbl&gt; 43, 43, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 26, 26, 26…\n$ target      &lt;dbl&gt; 41, 40, 51, 52, 53, 45, 44, 46, 48, 49, 47, 54, 27, 28, 29…\n$ SentDate    &lt;chr&gt; \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\"…\n$ SentTime    &lt;time&gt; 08:39:00, 08:39:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:0…\n$ Subject     &lt;chr&gt; \"GT-SeismicProcessorPro Bug Report\", \"GT-SeismicProcessorP…\n$ MainSubject &lt;chr&gt; \"Work related\", \"Work related\", \"Work related\", \"Work rela…\n$ sourceLabel &lt;chr&gt; \"Sven.Flecha\", \"Sven.Flecha\", \"Kanon.Herrero\", \"Kanon.Herr…\n$ targetLabel &lt;chr&gt; \"Isak.Baza\", \"Lucas.Alcazar\", \"Felix.Resumir\", \"Hideki.Coc…\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to perform the changes.\n\nGAStech_edges &lt;- GAStech_edges %&gt;%\n  mutate(SendDate = dmy(SentDate)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Weekday = wday(SentDate,\n                        label = TRUE,\n                        abbr = FALSE))\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above 1. both dmy() and wday() are functions of lubridate package. lubridate is an R package that makes it easier to work with dates and times. 2. dmy() transforms the SentDate to Date data type. 3. wday() returns the day of the week as a decimal number or an ordered factor if label is TRUE. The argument abbr is FALSE keep the daya spells in full, i.e. Monday. The function will create a new column in the data.frame i.e. Weekday and the output of wday() will save in this newly created field. 4. the values in the Weekday field are in ordinal scale.\n\n\n\nTable below shows the data structure of the reformatted GAStech_edges data frame\n\n\n\nA close examination of GAStech_edges data.frame reveals that it consists of individual e-mail flow records. This is not very useful for visualisation.\nIn view of this, we will aggregate the individual by date, senders, receivers, main subject and day of the week.\n\nGAStech_edges_aggregated &lt;- GAStech_edges %&gt;%\n  filter(MainSubject == \"Work related\") %&gt;%\n  group_by(source, target, Weekday) %&gt;%\n    summarise(Weight = n()) %&gt;%\n  filter(source!=target) %&gt;%\n  filter(Weight &gt; 1) %&gt;%\n  ungroup()\n\n`summarise()` has grouped output by 'source', 'target'. You can override using\nthe `.groups` argument.\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above: 1. four functions from dplyr package are used. They are: filter(), group(), summarise(), and ungroup(). 2. The output data.frame is called GAStech_edges_aggregated. 3. A new field called Weight has been added in GAStech_edges_aggregated.\n\n\n\nTable below shows the data structure of the reformatted GAStech_edges data frame\n\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will learn how to create a graph data model by using tidygraph package. It provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. tidygraph provides a way to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them. Furthermore it provides access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their use in a tidy workflow.\n\n\nTwo functions of tidygraph package can be used to create network objects, they are:\n\ntbl_graph() creates a tbl_graph network object from nodes and edges data.\nas_tbl_graph() converts network data and objects to a tbl_graph network. Below are network data and objects supported by as_tbl_graph()\n\n\na node data.frame and an edge data.frame,\ndata.frame, list, matrix from base,\nigraph from igraph,\nnetwork from network,\ndendrogram and hclust from stats,\nNode from data.tree,\nphylo and evonet from ape, and\ngraphNEL, graphAM, graphBAM from graph (in Bioconductor).\n\n\n\n\nactivate() verb from tidygraph serves as a switch between tibbles for nodes and edges. All dplyr verbs applied to tbl_graph object are applied to the active tibble.\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will use tbl_graph() of tinygraph package to build an tidygraph’s network graph data.frame.\nBefore typing the codes, you are recommended to review to reference guide of tbl_graph()\n\nGAStech_graph &lt;- tbl_graph(nodes = GAStech_nodes,\n                           edges = GAStech_edges_aggregated, \n                           directed = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nGAStech_graph\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# Node Data: 54 × 4 (active)\n      id label               Department     Title                               \n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                               \n 1     1 Mat.Bramar          Administration Assistant to CEO                    \n 2     2 Anda.Ribera         Administration Assistant to CFO                    \n 3     3 Rachel.Pantanal     Administration Assistant to CIO                    \n 4     4 Linda.Lagos         Administration Assistant to COO                    \n 5     5 Ruscella.Mies.Haber Administration Assistant to Engineering Group Mana…\n 6     6 Carla.Forluniau     Administration Assistant to IT Group Manager       \n 7     7 Cornelia.Lais       Administration Assistant to Security Group Manager \n 8    44 Kanon.Herrero       Security       Badging Office                      \n 9    45 Varja.Lagos         Security       Badging Office                      \n10    46 Stenig.Fusil        Security       Building Control                    \n# ℹ 44 more rows\n#\n# Edge Data: 1,372 × 4\n   from    to Weekday Weight\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1     1     2 星期日       5\n2     1     2 星期一       2\n3     1     2 星期二       3\n# ℹ 1,369 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output above reveals that GAStech_graph is a tbl_graph object with 54 nodes and 4541 edges. The command also prints the first six rows of “Node Data” and the first three of “Edge Data”. It states that the Node Data is active. The notion of an active tibble within a tbl_graph object makes it possible to manipulate the data in one tibble at a time.\n\n\n\nThe nodes tibble data frame is activated by default, but you can change which tibble data frame is active with the activate() function. Thus, if we wanted to rearrange the rows in the edges tibble to list those with the highest “weight” first, we could use activate() and then arrange().\nFor example,\n\nGAStech_graph %&gt;%\n  activate(edges) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Weight))\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# Edge Data: 1,372 × 4 (active)\n    from    to Weekday Weight\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n 1    40    41 星期六      13\n 2    41    43 星期一      11\n 3    35    31 星期二      10\n 4    40    41 星期一      10\n 5    40    43 星期一      10\n 6    36    32 星期日       9\n 7    40    43 星期六       9\n 8    41    40 星期一       9\n 9    19    15 星期三       8\n10    35    38 星期二       8\n# ℹ 1,362 more rows\n#\n# Node Data: 54 × 4\n     id label           Department     Title           \n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;           \n1     1 Mat.Bramar      Administration Assistant to CEO\n2     2 Anda.Ribera     Administration Assistant to CFO\n3     3 Rachel.Pantanal Administration Assistant to CIO\n# ℹ 51 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\nggraph is an extension of ggplot2, making it easier to carry over basic ggplot skills to the design of network graphs.\nAs in all network graph, there are three main aspects to a ggraph’s network graph, they are:\n\nnodes,\nedges and\nlayouts.\n\nFor a comprehensive discussion of each of this aspect of graph, please refer to their respective vignettes provided.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses ggraph(), geom-edge_link() and geom_node_point() to plot a network graph by using GAStech_graph. Before your get started, it is advisable to read their respective reference guide at least once.\n\nggraph(GAStech_graph) +\n  geom_edge_link() +\n  geom_node_point()\n\nUsing \"stress\" as default layout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above: The basic plotting function is ggraph(), which takes the data to be used for the graph and the type of layout desired. Both of the arguments for ggraph() are built around igraph. Therefore, ggraph() can use either an igraph object or a tbl_graph object.\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will use theme_graph() to remove the x and y axes. Before your get started, it is advisable to read it’s reference guide at least once.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes())\n\nUsing \"stress\" as default layout\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above: - ggraph introduces a special ggplot theme that provides better defaults for network graphs than the normal ggplot defaults. theme_graph(), besides removing axes, grids, and border, changes the font to Arial Narrow (this can be overridden). - The ggraph theme can be set for a series of plots with the set_graph_style() command run before the graphs are plotted or by using theme_graph() in the individual plots.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, theme_graph() makes it easy to change the coloring of the plot.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(colour = 'grey50')) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = 'grey40'))\n\nUsing \"stress\" as default layout\n\ng + theme_graph(background = 'grey10',\n                text_colour = 'white')\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_stringMetric, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label)): font family\nnot found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call(C_stringMetric, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label)): font family\nnot found in Windows font database\n\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\n\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggraph support many layout for standard used, they are: star, circle, nicely (default), dh, gem, graphopt, grid, mds, spahere, randomly, fr, kk, drl and lgl.

But, it can do more that that. In the example above, argument width is used to map the width of the line in proportional to the Weight attribute and argument alpha is used to introduce opacity on the line.\n\n##　27.6 Creating facet graphs\nAnother very useful feature of ggraph is faceting. In visualising network data, this technique can be used to reduce edge over-plotting in a very meaning way by spreading nodes and edges out based on their attributes. In this section, you will learn how to use faceting technique to visualise network data.\nThere are three functions in ggraph to implement faceting, they are:\n\nfacet_nodes() whereby edges are only draw in a panel if both terminal nodes are present here,\nfacet_edges() whereby nodes are always drawn in al panels even if the node data contains an attribute named the same as the one used for the edge facetting, and\nfacet_graph() faceting on two variables simultaneously.\n\n##　27.6.1 Working with facet_edges()\nIn the code chunk below, facet_edges() is used.

One contains the nodes data and the other contains the edges (also know as link) data.\n\n\nNote: GAStech-email_edges.csv which consists of two weeks of 9063 emails correspondances between 55 employees.\n\n\n\nNote: GAStech_email_nodes.csv which consist of the names, department and title of the 55 employees.\n\n\n\nIn this step, you will import GAStech_email_node.csv and GAStech_email_edges-v2.csv into RStudio environment by using read_csv() of readr package.\n\nGAStech_nodes &lt;- read_csv(\"data/GAStech_email_node.csv\")\n\nRows: 54 Columns: 4\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr (3): label, Department, Title\ndbl (1): id\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\nGAStech_edges &lt;- read_csv(\"data/GAStech_email_edge-v2.csv\")\n\nRows: 9063 Columns: 8\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\nchr  (5): SentDate, Subject, MainSubject, sourceLabel, targetLabel\ndbl  (2): source, target\ntime (1): SentTime\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n\n\n\nNext, we will examine the structure of the data frame using glimpse() of dplyr.\n\nglimpse(GAStech_edges)\n\nRows: 9,063\nColumns: 8\n$ source      &lt;dbl&gt; 43, 43, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 44, 26, 26, 26…\n$ target      &lt;dbl&gt; 41, 40, 51, 52, 53, 45, 44, 46, 48, 49, 47, 54, 27, 28, 29…\n$ SentDate    &lt;chr&gt; \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\", \"6/1/2014\"…\n$ SentTime    &lt;time&gt; 08:39:00, 08:39:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:00, 08:58:0…\n$ Subject     &lt;chr&gt; \"GT-SeismicProcessorPro Bug Report\", \"GT-SeismicProcessorP…\n$ MainSubject &lt;chr&gt; \"Work related\", \"Work related\", \"Work related\", \"Work rela…\n$ sourceLabel &lt;chr&gt; \"Sven.Flecha\", \"Sven.Flecha\", \"Kanon.Herrero\", \"Kanon.Herr…\n$ targetLabel &lt;chr&gt; \"Isak.Baza\", \"Lucas.Alcazar\", \"Felix.Resumir\", \"Hideki.Coc…\n\n\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below will be used to perform the changes.\n\nGAStech_edges &lt;- GAStech_edges %&gt;%\n  mutate(SendDate = dmy(SentDate)) %&gt;%\n  mutate(Weekday = wday(SentDate,\n                        label = TRUE,\n                        abbr = FALSE))\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above 1. both dmy() and wday() are functions of lubridate package. lubridate is an R package that makes it easier to work with dates and times. 2. dmy() transforms the SentDate to Date data type. 3. wday() returns the day of the week as a decimal number or an ordered factor if label is TRUE. The argument abbr is FALSE keep the daya spells in full, i.e. Monday. The function will create a new column in the data.frame i.e. Weekday and the output of wday() will save in this newly created field. 4. the values in the Weekday field are in ordinal scale.\n\n\n\nTable below shows the data structure of the reformatted GAStech_edges data frame\n\n\n\nA close examination of GAStech_edges data.frame reveals that it consists of individual e-mail flow records.

You can override using\nthe `.groups` argument.\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above: 1. four functions from dplyr package are used. They are: filter(), group(), summarise(), and ungroup(). 2. The output data.frame is called GAStech_edges_aggregated. 3. A new field called Weight has been added in GAStech_edges_aggregated.\n\n\n\nTable below shows the data structure of the reformatted GAStech_edges data frame"

    "text": "In this section, you will learn how to create a graph data model by using tidygraph package. It provides a tidy API for graph/network manipulation. While network data itself is not tidy, it can be envisioned as two tidy tables, one for node data and one for edge data. tidygraph provides a way to switch between the two tables and provides dplyr verbs for manipulating them. Furthermore it provides access to a lot of graph algorithms with return values that facilitate their use in a tidy workflow.\n\n\nTwo functions of tidygraph package can be used to create network objects, they are:\n\ntbl_graph() creates a tbl_graph network object from nodes and edges data.\nas_tbl_graph() converts network data and objects to a tbl_graph network. Below are network data and objects supported by as_tbl_graph()\n\n\na node data.frame and an edge data.frame,\ndata.frame, list, matrix from base,\nigraph from igraph,\nnetwork from network,\ndendrogram and hclust from stats,\nNode from data.tree,\nphylo and evonet from ape, and\ngraphNEL, graphAM, graphBAM from graph (in Bioconductor).\n\n\n\n\nactivate() verb from tidygraph serves as a switch between tibbles for nodes and edges. All dplyr verbs applied to tbl_graph object are applied to the active tibble.\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will use tbl_graph() of tinygraph package to build an tidygraph’s network graph data.frame.\nBefore typing the codes, you are recommended to review to reference guide of tbl_graph()\n\nGAStech_graph &lt;- tbl_graph(nodes = GAStech_nodes,\n                           edges = GAStech_edges_aggregated, \n                           directed = TRUE)\n\n\n\n\n\nGAStech_graph\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# Node Data: 54 × 4 (active)\n      id label               Department     Title                               \n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;               &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;                               \n 1     1 Mat.Bramar          Administration Assistant to CEO                    \n 2     2 Anda.Ribera         Administration Assistant to CFO                    \n 3     3 Rachel.Pantanal     Administration Assistant to CIO                    \n 4     4 Linda.Lagos         Administration Assistant to COO                    \n 5     5 Ruscella.Mies.Haber Administration Assistant to Engineering Group Mana…\n 6     6 Carla.Forluniau     Administration Assistant to IT Group Manager       \n 7     7 Cornelia.Lais       Administration Assistant to Security Group Manager \n 8    44 Kanon.Herrero       Security       Badging Office                      \n 9    45 Varja.Lagos         Security       Badging Office                      \n10    46 Stenig.Fusil        Security       Building Control                    \n# ℹ 44 more rows\n#\n# Edge Data: 1,372 × 4\n   from    to Weekday Weight\n  &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n1     1     2 星期日       5\n2     1     2 星期一       2\n3     1     2 星期二       3\n# ℹ 1,369 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\nThe output above reveals that GAStech_graph is a tbl_graph object with 54 nodes and 4541 edges. The command also prints the first six rows of “Node Data” and the first three of “Edge Data”. It states that the Node Data is active. The notion of an active tibble within a tbl_graph object makes it possible to manipulate the data in one tibble at a time.\n\n\n\nThe nodes tibble data frame is activated by default, but you can change which tibble data frame is active with the activate() function. Thus, if we wanted to rearrange the rows in the edges tibble to list those with the highest “weight” first, we could use activate() and then arrange().\nFor example,\n\nGAStech_graph %&gt;%\n  activate(edges) %&gt;%\n  arrange(desc(Weight))\n\n# A tbl_graph: 54 nodes and 1372 edges\n#\n# A directed multigraph with 1 component\n#\n# Edge Data: 1,372 × 4 (active)\n    from    to Weekday Weight\n   &lt;int&gt; &lt;int&gt; &lt;ord&gt;    &lt;int&gt;\n 1    40    41 星期六      13\n 2    41    43 星期一      11\n 3    35    31 星期二      10\n 4    40    41 星期一      10\n 5    40    43 星期一      10\n 6    36    32 星期日       9\n 7    40    43 星期六       9\n 8    41    40 星期一       9\n 9    19    15 星期三       8\n10    35    38 星期二       8\n# ℹ 1,362 more rows\n#\n# Node Data: 54 × 4\n     id label           Department     Title           \n  &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;chr&gt;           &lt;chr&gt;          &lt;chr&gt;           \n1     1 Mat.Bramar      Administration Assistant to CEO\n2     2 Anda.Ribera     Administration Assistant to CFO\n3     3 Rachel.Pantanal Administration Assistant to CIO\n# ℹ 51 more rows\n\n\n\n\n\nggraph is an extension of ggplot2, making it easier to carry over basic ggplot skills to the design of network graphs.\nAs in all network graph, there are three main aspects to a ggraph’s network graph, they are:\n\nnodes,\nedges and\nlayouts.\n\nFor a comprehensive discussion of each of this aspect of graph, please refer to their respective vignettes provided.\n\n\n\nThe code chunk below uses ggraph(), geom-edge_link() and geom_node_point() to plot a network graph by using GAStech_graph. Before your get started, it is advisable to read their respective reference guide at least once.\n\nggraph(GAStech_graph) +\n  geom_edge_link() +\n  geom_node_point()\n\nUsing \"stress\" as default layout\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above: The basic plotting function is ggraph(), which takes the data to be used for the graph and the type of layout desired. Both of the arguments for ggraph() are built around igraph. Therefore, ggraph() can use either an igraph object or a tbl_graph object.\n\n\n\nIn this section, you will use theme_graph() to remove the x and y axes. Before your get started, it is advisable to read it’s reference guide at least once.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes()) +\n  geom_node_point(aes())\n\nUsing \"stress\" as default layout\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunk above: - ggraph introduces a special ggplot theme that provides better defaults for network graphs than the normal ggplot defaults. theme_graph(), besides removing axes, grids, and border, changes the font to Arial Narrow (this can be overridden). - The ggraph theme can be set for a series of plots with the set_graph_style() command run before the graphs are plotted or by using theme_graph() in the individual plots.\n\n\n\nFurthermore, theme_graph() makes it easy to change the coloring of the plot.\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph) + \n  geom_edge_link(aes(colour = 'grey50')) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = 'grey40'))\n\nUsing \"stress\" as default layout\n\ng + theme_graph(background = 'grey10',\n                text_colour = 'white')\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_stringMetric, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label)): font family\nnot found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call(C_stringMetric, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label)): font family\nnot found in Windows font database\n\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\n\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nggraph support many layout for standard used, they are: star, circle, nicely (default), dh, gem, graphopt, grid, mds, spahere, randomly, fr, kk, drl and lgl.

It allows for simple plotting of nodes in different shapes, colours and sizes. In the codes chnuks above colour and size are used.\n\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") +\n  geom_edge_link(aes(width=Weight), \n                 alpha=0.2) +\n  scale_edge_width(range = c(0.1, 5)) +\n  geom_node_point(aes(colour = Department), \n                  size = 3)\n\ng + theme_graph()\n\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call(C_textBounds, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, : font\nfamily not found in Windows font database\n\n\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\nWarning in grid.Call.graphics(C_text, as.graphicsAnnot(x$label), x$x, x$y, :\nfont family not found in Windows font database\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThings to learn from the code chunks above:\n\ngeom_edge_link draws edges in the simplest way - as straight lines between the start and end nodes. But, it can do more that that. In the example above, argument width is used to map the width of the line in proportional to the Weight attribute and argument alpha is used to introduce opacity on the line.\n\n##　27.6 Creating facet graphs\nAnother very useful feature of ggraph is faceting. In visualising network data, this technique can be used to reduce edge over-plotting in a very meaning way by spreading nodes and edges out based on their attributes. In this section, you will learn how to use faceting technique to visualise network data.\nThere are three functions in ggraph to implement faceting, they are:\n\nfacet_nodes() whereby edges are only draw in a panel if both terminal nodes are present here,\nfacet_edges() whereby nodes are always drawn in al panels even if the node data contains an attribute named the same as the one used for the edge facetting, and\nfacet_graph() faceting on two variables simultaneously.\n\n##　27.6.1 Working with facet_edges()\nIn the code chunk below, facet_edges() is used. Before getting started, it is advisable for you to read it’s reference guide at least once.\n\nset_graph_style()\n\ng &lt;- ggraph(GAStech_graph, \n            layout = \"nicely\") + \n

I would look at the trend of popularity of “PerformerOf” , “ComposerOf” , “ProducerOf”, LyricsOf”, “RecordedBy” , “DistributedBy” the Ocernus Folk genre of songs or album after 2018.\nb.What genres and top artists have been most influenced by Oceanus Folk?\nThere are few indicators to look at the Oceanus Folk influence over the musical industry. Firstly, “ComposerOf” suggests the number of composer composing Oceanus Folk, which indirectly suggesting the influence of the popularity of Oceanus Folk music. Similarly, “ProducerOf” also indicates the popularity of that genre of music. As for “InstyleOf”, I would like to show the number of non-Oceanus Folk nodes that is performed in the style of Oceanus Folk genre of songs, album, person or musical group. Last but not least, “DirectlySamples” also suggests the popularity of the genre of the Oceanus Folk. To gain popularity, artist tend to follow the trnding genre during the period.\nc.On the converse, how has Oceanus Folk changed with the rise of Sailor Shift? From which genres does it draw most of its contemporary inspiration?"
